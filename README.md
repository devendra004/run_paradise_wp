# Marathone Event

The project is developed from scratch, we created PSD design mockups. After approval we converted it into mark up and created custom theme as per the site features.
The website is fully customized as per the need of non technical person. Admin can easily change all the events, contents, courses, graphics etc from back end. We create custom post type for each individual block.The site is multilingual and we used qTranslate-X plugin for this. The other plugins used are, advanced custom fields, custom facebook feeds, custom post type UI, Unite gallery light etc.

We also created a child theme in order to avoid the risk of accidentally damaging the themeâ€™s functionality.
